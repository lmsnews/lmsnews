                    <p class="card-text">Abyss Proxy, created by Paxton Warin and two unnamed developers, was released on 10/1. All three of these people are very well respected in their fields of developement. Thanks to an interview with one of the developers, we have lots of details regarding the developement of Abyss Proxy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "One of the many difficulties in the developement of Abyss Proxy was to get Paxton to do anything at all," says the developers, "The only reason why we kept Paxton was to keep running the servers." This was quite an interesting statement due to the fact that Paxton had a reputation for being head developer for former proxies such as Phoenix Proxy.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Abyss Proxy has been been a big success overall. It is used by people all over the Fairfax County district. Users have very satisfying reviews, but there are still a few flaws. "Abyss Proxy is great, but the new update takes up a lot of screen space," says Ethan Estrada, a Longfellow Student. "Basically, the proxy is great, but sometimes detectable," says another user, "There should also be a tab cloaking feature."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On the other hand, Abyss Proxy is quite the problem for school officials. Many proxies created in the past by Longfellow Students have been blocked on the school computer. "This is different, though," says the developers, "We can just change the URL to the proxy if the previous one is blocked."
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Overall, Abyss Proxy is a great proxy to use. Many people who use it give great reviews and it is used by people all over the district. We want to thank all of the people who agreed to have an interview.
